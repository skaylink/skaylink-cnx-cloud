Create an HCL Connections Component Pack installation on managed Kubernetes
===========================================================================

HCL Connections Component Pack is based on Docker Images and should be deployed on a Kubernetes Cluster. The documentation lines out the installation on a private Kubernetes cluster only. This repository contains documentation and supporting scripts to deploy HCL Connections Component Pack on an AWS EKS Kubernetes Cluster.

In case there is interest, the documentation can be enhanced to document the installation on Azure AKS or Googles GKE.

This documentation provides information and installation guidelines to get HCL Connections Component Pack running on a managed Kubernetes service on one of the main cloud providers.

This repository is a successor of the previous installation instructions for IBM Connections Component Pack 6 and HCL Connections Component Pack 7.
The old repository can be found at https://becketalservices.github.io/beas-cnx-cloud/
